# BB(6) / Antihydra non-halting — current state, for external review

*Self-contained summary of a research programme aimed at proving the open kernel behind BB(6). All "verified"
facts are machine-checked (exact integer/rational arithmetic where stated); "measured" facts are numerical.
Discipline: 0 false proofs; ~8 tempting leads were retracted after failing verification. Looking for expert
input on the directions and on whether any technique we missed could apply. Questions at the end.*

## 1. The problem
The Busy Beaver value **BB(6) is open and provably "Hard"**: the bbchallenge community reduced it to ~1104
"holdout" 6-state Turing machines ("cryptids"), each equivalent to a number-theoretic open problem. The
flagship is **Antihydra**: the integer orbit
```
c_{n+1} = floor(3 c_n / 2),   c_0 = 8     (8,12,18,27,40,60,90,135,...)
```
The machine halts iff the "balance" `balance_n = 3 E_n − n` (E_n = #even among c_0..c_{n−1}) ever reaches −1.
Conjecturally it never halts (probabilistic heuristic: even-density → 1/2 > 1/3). Deciding it is equivalent
to a statement about the equidistribution of this orbit, in the same class as **Mahler's 3/2 problem (1968)**.

## 2. Exact reduction to a single hypothesis (verified)
Define the parity bits `e_j = [c_j odd]`. Exact identities (verified):
```
2^n c_n = 8·3^n − S_n ,   S_{n+1} = 3 S_n + 2^n e_n ,   S_n = Σ_{j<n, e_j=1} 2^j 3^{n−1−j}
depth_n := v2(c_n − 1) = v2(8·3^n − S_n − 2^n) − n
```
**Renewal structure (verified):** `depth_n` counts down deterministically (`d≥1 ⇒ d−1`) and, at even steps
(`c=2c'`), jumps to a fresh `D = v2(3c' − 1)`. **Exact halting criterion** [corrected after review]:
```
non-halt  ⟺  balance_n = 3 E_n − n ≥ 0  for ALL n   ⟺   running even-density E_n/n ≥ 1/3 at every prefix.
```
The following are **SUFFICIENT** (the standard heuristic), NOT equivalent — non-halt does not force `depth`
sublinear, and *fixed-k* equidistribution alone is not enough (one needs control as the window grows with n):
```
[ suitable growing-window equidistribution of the renewal states c'_j mod 2^k ]
      ⟹  even-density → 1/2  and  geometric depth tails  ⟹  depth_n = o(n)  and  balance_n ≥ 0 ∀n  ⟹  non-halt.
```
**The 2-adic engine (verified, exact arithmetic):** `T(x)=floor(3x/2)` is a measure-preserving 2-to-1 EXACT
endomorphism of ℤ₂. The induced low-digit chain on ℤ/2^k has Dobrushin coefficient `δ(P^k)=0` (it forgets its
state in exactly k steps), and the k-step map (k incoming high digits → state mod 2^k) is a **bijection**.
This yields a **rigorous conditional theorem**:
> **(Conditional theorem.)** If the incoming high digit `bit_k(c_n)` is asymptotically independent of the
> low-digit state `c_n mod 2^k`  [call this **(H)**], then even-density = 1/2 and Antihydra never halts.
Everything except (H) is unconditional. **(H) is SUFFICIENT for non-halt, and — under the renewal coding —
is essentially equivalent to (more precisely, reduces to / is implied by) equidistribution of the diagonal
bit `bit_n(3^n) = floor((3/2)^n) mod 2`.** [weakened from "⟺" after review.] (The same structure unifies
the other cryptids: multiplier `2^a/3^b`, shrinking base `p`,
diagonal digit `floor((2^a/3^b)^n) mod p`; e.g. o18 uses 8/3, p=3, where the digit `=2` is literally Erdős's
ternary-digit-of-2^n problem.)

## 3. What is measured (robust numerics)
- Full `√N` cancellation in Weyl sums `Σ_{n≤N} e(h(3/2)^n)`; `{(3/2)^n}` equidistributes.
- even-density → 1/2 (margin ≫ 1/3); `P(depth ≥ L) = 2^{−L}` to high precision (geometric).
- All fixed bit positions equidistribute (shift-invariance, spread 0.0027 over k=0..15).
- `bit_k(c_n) ⊥ c_n mod 2^k`: mutual information ≈ 0 (~1000× margin) — i.e. (H) holds empirically.
- 2-adic ⊥ 3-adic (MI≈0); the 3-adic expansion re-encodes the parity history (`c_n mod 9 ↔ (parity_{n−1},
  parity_{n−2})` bijectively).
- Renewal jump heights **behave as an iid-geometric renewal process** with zero drift (centered sums ~ `√N`
  random walk). [What is established: geometric tail, lag-k decorrelation/`MI≈0`, renewal mixing; full
  independence is NOT claimed.]
- **The parity sequence has MAXIMAL linear complexity (= M/2, Berlekamp–Massey)**: it is the nonlinear filter
  (the moving bit-n extraction) of the linear-feedback carry `S_n` — a max-complexity self-referential generator.

## 4. The obstruction map — why every known technique fails (the crux)
| technique | precise reason it does NOT apply |
|---|---|
| van der Corput / Weyl differencing | **closed** on the multiplicative recurrence `(3/2)^n` (it is a fixed point of differencing; measured: differenced sums stay `O(√N)`, no gain) |
| sum-product (Bourgain–Konyagin, …) | needs a subgroup `|H| ≥ q^δ`; here `{3^j mod 2^k}` with `k ~ cn` is **log-size** in the modulus — exponentially below threshold |
| Fourier / large-sieve / Stewart–Baker | control the **off-diagonal** (low bits = the `×3`-coset, where the character sum cancels unconditionally); but the depth/parity live at the **moving 2-adic diagonal** (bit at position ~n), unreachable. Large-sieve also fails: the linear form sits on a thin `×3`-subgroup (2nd moment `~189N`). Stewart bounds the *archimedean* digit-count of `3^n` (→∞), uncorrelated with the *2-adic* trailing-zero depth |
| measure rigidity (Furstenberg–Rudolph–Lindenstrauss / ELV) | a **rank ≥ 2** phenomenon (full `{×2,×3}` action); the orbit iterates ONE map `×3/2` = **rank 1**; rank-1 has a continuum of invariant measures, no rigidity. (Verified: the orbit is not `×2`- or `×3`-invariant) |
| subspace theorem (Schmidt/Ridout) | gives `o(n)` digit-runs for a **fixed algebraic number**; ours is a **moving integer orbit** |
| self-consistency / fixed-point uniqueness | **circular**: feeding the incoming digit independently of the state already assumes (H) |
| **Tao (2019) Collatz transport/entropy** | proves equidistribution for **almost all** starting points (log-density 1); decides **no single orbit**. Antihydra is one specific orbit (seed 8). This is the **closest existing technique** and it still hits the same single-orbit wall |

**Unified diagnosis.** Every known tool controls a *generic / averaged / fixed / off-diagonal* slice perfectly
and fails identically on the **specific orbit at the moving 2-adic diagonal**.

## 5. The open kernel as seen from four closely related viewpoints
*(These are tightly linked under the renewal coding, not asserted as strictly equivalent.)*
1. **Arithmetic:** a sufficient / essentially controlling form is that `floor((3/2)^n) mod 2` equidistributes
   (Mahler-3/2; for base 3: Erdős ternary).
2. **Dynamical:** the seed `8 ∈ ℤ` (a Haar-null point) is non-exceptional for the exact ℤ₂-endomorphism `T`.
3. **Probabilistic:** (H) — incoming high digit ⊥ low-digit state.
4. **Sequence-design:** the even-density of the nonlinear-filtered, max-linear-complexity carry `S_n` is 1/2.

## 6. First unconditional partials (what we CAN prove)
- `depth_n ≤ 0.585 n` (trivial 2-adic bound).
- **Infinitely many even terms** (the orbit cannot stay `≡1 mod 4`/odd forever — that forces `c=1`).
- **`E_n = Ω(log n)`** even terms: consecutive even positions satisfy `p_{i+1} ≤ 1.585 p_i` (from `depth ≤ log2 c`),
  geometric, so `E_n ≥ log N / log 1.585`. (Far below the needed positive density.)
- Off-diagonal (fixed-modulus) character-sum cancellation, unconditional.
- Top `~log n` bits equidistribute (Weyl/Benford on `{n log2 3}`; `log2 3` is not Liouville, CF max partial
  quotient 55 in first 25 terms). Hard barrier: this reaches only `Θ(log n)` bits, the diagonal is at `Θ(n)`.

## 6.5 NEW conditional theorem — the moment / additive-energy route (strongest concrete lead, NEW)

```
**Derivation.** With renewal jumps `D_j = v2(3c'_j − 1)`, `avg jump = (1/J)Σ_k N_k`,
`N_k = #{j≤J : c'_j ≡ 3^{−1} mod 2^k}`. By Hölder `N_k ≤ (Σ_r count_r(k)^{2m})^{1/2m}`. If the **2m-th moment**
`M_{2m}(k)=Σ_r count_r(k)^{2m}` is of random order `O(J^{2m}/2^{(2m−1)k})`, then
`avg jump ≤ C^{1/2m}·Σ_{k≥1} 2^{−k(2m−1)/2m}`. Thresholds: 2nd moment → even-density `≥ 0.293` (just under
1/3); **4th moment → `≥ 0.405 > 1/3`**; 6th → `0.44`. With the empirical constant `C≈1.3` the 4th-moment
bound gives even-density `≥ 0.39`.
This **reduces non-halt from full equidistribution to a 4th additive-energy bound** — a different,
additive-combinatorial target. The moment counts `#{(i₁..i₄): c'_{i₁}≡…≡c'_{i₄} mod 2^k}` = collisions
`v2(c'_i − c'_j) ≥ k` of a **geometric-growth** induced orbit. **Caveat (honest):** the orbit is
`c'_j = A_j·(9/4)^j` where the prefactor `A_j` carries the parity history (self-referential) — so `c'_j` is
*not* a clean S-unit, and p-adic Baker / linear forms in logarithms is **a possible route, not an immediate
application** (one must handle the fluctuating `A_j`). Equally, additive-energy machinery for geometric/
multiplicatively-structured sequences may bound the moment. (This is the most promising near-term route and
the natural place for additive-combinatorics / Diophantine expertise.)

**A second framing of the same hypothesis (NEW, in a classical dynamical framework).** The induced map `F` is
verified (100%, exact) to be a **full-branch, piecewise-affine, expanding map of `ℤ₂`**: on each cylinder
`P_D = {v2(3c'−1)=D}` (Haar measure `2^{−(D+1)}`, geometric), `F` is affine with 2-adic slope `(3/2)^{D+1}`,
**expansion `2^{D+1} ≥ 2`, zero distortion**, and each branch maps **onto all of `ℤ₂`**; `F` preserves Haar
(Kac). These verified facts (full branches, affine, expanding, **zero distortion**) are exactly the structural
hypotheses of a **Gibbs–Markov map**, so `F` **appears to satisfy the standard Gibbs–Markov hypotheses** — the
cleanest setting for Ruelle–Perron–Frobenius transfer operators (we state this as a structural match, not a
proven classification; the tail/big-image conditions should be confirmed by a specialist).
**A sharpening of the target (NEW, verified 100%): the induced map advances the renewal sequence,
`c'_{i+1} = F(c'_i)`** (exact, `ok=1999/1999`). Hence `F^d(c'_i) = c'_{i+d}`, and the additive energy
`E_2(k) = Σ_d #{i: F^d(c'_i) ≡ c'_i} = #{(i,j): v2(c'_i−c'_j) ≥ k}` **is literally the 2-adic self-correlation
(collision count) of the renewal sequence at the moving diagonal.** This is a **decay-of-correlations**
statement, and the relevant **function space is locally-constant / Lipschitz functions w.r.t. the 2-adic
metric** — in which the additive-energy observables (`2^k`-cylinder indicators) sit (they are locally
constant). For Gibbs–Markov maps, **exponential decay of correlations on Lipschitz is classical**. Crucially
transfer operators are **rank-1-compatible**, evading the rank-≥2 rigidity obstruction. (Measured: the
collision count is `J` (the trivial diagonal) `+ J^2/2^k` (random) to high precision — no over-concentration —
but this is the *specific orbit*, which is the open part.) **The one honest gap:** decay of correlations is for
the invariant (Haar) measure, whereas the additive energy is along the *specific* orbit. In `L²` terms the
needed bound is equivalent to a **one-sided anti-concentration** — *no `2^k`-cylinder is over-visited by the
orbit* — which is formally **weaker** than equidistribution but is still a single-orbit (not measure)
statement. Connecting the two (or showing the one-sided `≤ C·random` bound follows robustly from the spectral
gap) is the precise remaining question (see Q9). This places the problem on a different, well-developed
battlefield rather than the moving-diagonal wall.

## 7. What a proof needs (precise targets for a new tool)
- **(α)** equidistribution of a **rank-1 specific orbit** of `×(2^a/3^b)` — i.e. effective "rank-1
  Furstenberg" with a Diophantine condition on `log2 3`; OR
- **(β)** a **sub-linear 2-adic depth bound** `depth_n = o(n)` for the self-referential linear-feedback carry
  `S_n` (improve the trivial `≤ 0.585 n`) — i.e. control the moving 2-adic diagonal digit.
Constraints (from failed leads): must engage the state↔incoming coupling (not assume independence); must be
intrinsically 2-adic (archimedean misses the depth); must be single-orbit (not almost-all); must survive
verification on the real orbit.

## 8. Candidate seeds we have not been able to develop
2-adic renewal/thermodynamic formalism (a transfer operator on the *orbit's* law, not the state's); a theory
of self-referentially-defined 2-adic constants' digit normality (`S_n/3^{n−1} → Σ_{e_j=1}(2/3)^j`); adapting
nonlinear-filter/linear-complexity (sequence-design) tools to this specific generator; a single-orbit
strengthening of Tao's transport method; anti-concentration for linear forms with explicit `2^j 3^{n−1−j}`
coefficients at a moving modulus.

## 9. Questions for the reviewer
1. Is there a technique we missed that controls a **single specific orbit** at a **moving 2-adic position**
   (as opposed to almost-all / off-diagonal)? Any 2-adic/p-adic equidistribution machinery for individual
   trajectories of `×(p/q)`-type maps?
2. Can Tao's (2019) transport/entropy method be **localized to a single orbit** under a Diophantine condition,
   or is the almost-all step fundamental?
3. Does the **maximal-linear-complexity / nonlinear-filtered-LFSR** framing connect to any provable
   correlation/anti-concentration bound for *this specific* generator?
4. Is there a known conditional reduction of Mahler-3/2 (or single-orbit Collatz equidistribution) to a more
   standard conjecture (effective `×2,×3`; GRH-type; abc; a Diophantine statement on `log2 3`)?
5. For the linear depth-form `depth_n ≥ L ⟺ S_n ≡ 8·3^n − 2^n (mod 2^{n+L})` with explicit
   `2^j 3^{n−1−j}` coefficients: is the moving-modulus exponential sum amenable to any method? (It is
   *linear in the parity variables `e_j` once the orbit is fixed* — unlike the nonlinear Mahler sum — though
   the `e_j` are themselves the orbit's bits, so the form is self-referential.)
6. **[from review — the most promising weakening]** Antihydra needs only a **one-sided** statement
   (running even-density `≥ 1/3`), NOT full equidistribution (`= 1/2`). **Is there any known method giving a
   one-sided lower bound on the frequency of a single MOVING digit** (e.g. "the diagonal bit is 0 with
   density `≥ 1/3`") that falls short of, and is easier than, full equidistribution? Our only unconditional
   one-sided result is `E_n = Ω(log n)`; can the `> 1/3` target admit a weaker-than-equidistribution tool?
   *(Sharpened: in renewal terms `non-halt ⟺ Σ_{j≤J}(D_j−1) ≤ J ∀J`, `D_j=v2(3c'_j−1)`; the true centered
   sum is ~`√J` while we only need `≤ J` — a ~250× margin empirically. The weakest sufficient target is
   `Σ_{j≤J} v2(3c'_j−1) = O(J)` for ANY constant, i.e. just **positive** even-density `≥ 1/C` — strictly
   weaker than equidistribution. Still open: the trivial `depth ≤ 0.585·pos` gives only `Ω(log)` evens.)*
7. **[from review — is the obstruction intrinsic or an artifact?]** Our obstruction map says every known tool
   fails at the **moving 2-adic diagonal**. But "moving diagonal" is a feature of *our* coordinates
   (`bit_n` of `3^n`, modulus `2^{n+L}`). **Is there any known coordinate change, group/solenoid extension, or
   symbolic realization that converts this moving diagonal into a FIXED observable** (where standard
   equidistribution/mixing tools would apply)? A breakthrough may come from re-coordinatizing the problem
   before any new theorem. *(Our preliminary view: the solenoid and the induced first-return map both DO turn
   the moving diagonal into a fixed observable — but along a **rank-1** orbit, and rank is coordinate-
   invariant; so the moving diagonal looks like a removable artifact while the **rank-1 specific-orbit**
   obstruction underneath looks intrinsic. The orbit is the diagonal `a=b=n` slice of `3^a/2^b` and does not
   fill the rank-2 action — is there a non-obvious coordinate embedding the rank-1 slice into a genuinely
   rank-≥2 / mixing structure?)*
8. **[the most actionable — additive energy]** Can the **4th additive-energy moment**
   `Σ_r #{j≤J: c'_j ≡ r mod 2^k}^4` of the geometric-growth induced orbit `c'_j` (where `c'_{j+1}≈(9/4)c'_j`)
   be bounded by `O(J^4/2^{3k})` **unconditionally**? Equivalently, bound the collision count
   `#{(i,j): v2(c'_i − c'_j) ≥ k}`. Does **p-adic Baker / linear forms in logarithms** give a lower bound on
   `v2(c'_i − c'_j)` for such an orbit (the differences are S-unit-like)? By §6.5 this would prove Antihydra
   never halts.
9. **[the most promising — Gibbs–Markov / transfer operator]** `F` is verified to be a **full-branch,
   piecewise-affine, expanding map of `ℤ₂`** (affine slopes `(3/2)^{D+1}`, zero distortion, full branches,
   Haar-preserving) — i.e. it **appears to satisfy the standard Gibbs–Markov hypotheses** (we state the
   structural match, not a proven classification). And (verified 100%) **the induced map advances the renewal
   sequence**: `c'_{i+1}=F(c'_i)`, so `F^d(c'_i)=c'_{i+d}` and the additive energy is exactly the renewal
   sequence's 2-adic self-correlation `#{(i,j): v2(c'_i−c'_j)≥k}`. (a) Does its Ruelle operator have a
   **spectral gap on 2-adic-Lipschitz functions** (please confirm the tail/big-image conditions are met by the
   geometric branch widths `2^{−(D+1)}`)? (b) **The crux:** decay of correlations is for the Haar measure, but
   the additive energy is along the *specific* orbit. In `L²` the needed bound is a **one-sided
   anti-concentration** — no `2^k`-cylinder is over-visited by the orbit — formally **weaker** than
   equidistribution but still single-orbit. Does the spectral gap give this one-sided bound
   `E_4 ≤ C·J^4/2^{3k}` for a single orbit (`§6.5` needs only `≤ C·random`, not equidistribution) — e.g. via a
   large-deviation bound on cylinder visit counts — or does even the one-sided `L²` bound reduce back to
   specific-orbit equidistribution? This is the precise question on which the whole transfer-operator route
   turns, and (the reviewer's framing) it may be the *real* open core — **single-orbit extraction from a
   Gibbs–Markov system** — rather than Mahler-3/2 per se.

## Appendix A — derivation of the moment-method thresholds (§6.5), line by line
*So a reviewer can check exactly where `0.405` and the `C ≤ 3.45` threshold come from.*

**Setup.** Renewal jumps `D_j = v2(3c'_j − 1)`, `j = 1..J`. `D_j ≥ k ⟺ c'_j ≡ 3^{−1} (mod 2^k)`. Write
`N_k := #{ j ≤ J : D_j ≥ k } = count_{3^{−1}}(k)`, `count_r(k) := #{ j ≤ J : c'_j ≡ r (mod 2^k)}`.

**(1) Even-density in terms of the average jump.** Each renewal cycle is one even step plus `D_j` odd steps,
so total steps `n = J + Σ_j D_j` and `even-density = J / n = 1 / (1 + avg jump)`, `avg jump = (1/J) Σ_j D_j`.
Therefore `even-density ≥ 1/3 ⟺ avg jump ≤ 2`.

**(2) Average jump as a sum of tail counts.** `Σ_j D_j = Σ_j Σ_{k≥1} 1[D_j ≥ k] = Σ_{k≥1} N_k`, so
`avg jump = (1/J) Σ_{k≥1} N_k`.

**(3) Bound one tail count by a moment (Hölder/`ℓ^{2m}`).** For any integer `m ≥ 1`,
`N_k = count_{3^{−1}}(k) ≤ ( Σ_r count_r(k)^{2m} )^{1/2m} =: M_{2m}(k)^{1/2m}`.

**(4) The hypothesis (random-order `2m`-th moment).** Assume `M_{2m}(k) ≤ C · J^{2m} / 2^{(2m−1)k}` for all
`k` (the value for a uniform distribution of `J` points over `2^k` residues is exactly `J^{2m}/2^{(2m−1)k}`
to leading order; `C` measures the excess over uniform). Then
`N_k ≤ C^{1/2m} · J · 2^{−k(2m−1)/2m}`.

**(5) Sum the geometric series.** Let `θ = (2m−1)/2m` and `q = 2^{−θ}`. Then
`avg jump ≤ C^{1/2m} · Σ_{k≥1} 2^{−kθ} = C^{1/2m} · q/(1−q) =: C^{1/2m} · g(m)`, with
`g(m) = 2^{−θ}/(1 − 2^{−θ})`.

**(6) Numbers.**
```
 m   2m   θ=(2m−1)/2m   g(m)=q/(1−q)   even-density at C=1 = 1/(1+g)   threshold  C ≤ (2/g)^{2m}
 1    2     0.500          2.4142             0.2929                       0.69     (cannot reach 1/3)
 2    4     0.750          1.4667             0.4054                       3.46  ←  the 4th-moment route
 3    6     0.833          1.2791             0.4388                      14.61
 4    8     0.875          1.1990             0.4547                      59.92
```
**(7) Where `3.45` comes from.** Even-density `≥ 1/3 ⟺ avg jump ≤ 2 ⟺ C^{1/2m} g(m) ≤ 2 ⟺
C ≤ (2/g(m))^{2m}`. For `m = 2`: `(2/1.4667)^4 = 1.3636^4 = 3.457`. So the 4th-moment hypothesis with any
constant `C ≤ 3.45` proves `even-density ≥ 1/3`. Measured 4th moment: `C ≈ 1.3` (comfortably inside).

**Remarks.** (i) The 2nd moment alone is hopeless (`C ≤ 0.69` needs the moment *below* uniform, impossible
since the diagonal `i=j` already forces `C ≥ 1`). The **4th moment is the first that can work**, and it has
real slack (`3.45` vs measured `1.3`). (ii) Larger `m` only loosens the constant further (`C ≤ 14.6, 59.9, …`)
— but `M_{2m}` is a higher additive energy, presumably harder to bound; the 4th moment is the sweet spot.
(iii) This is a *sufficient* condition for one-sided density `> 1/3` (hence non-halt); it does **not** need
full equidistribution. The open problem is purely the bound in step (4) for `m=2`.
