# The integer-×2 base-2 odometer machine — Lean 4 formalization (namespace `X2`)

Formalizes the frontier machine

  x2 = `1RB0RE_1RC---_0LD1LE_0RE1LD_1RF0LC_0RA1RE`  (blank tape),

mirroring the machine-formalization template of `Template.lean` / `O3.lean`
(zipper `St`/`Tape`/`Cfg`, `step`/`steps`/`steps_add`, sweep-by-induction).
Scope: the LOCAL even-structure channel — this file does NOT decide the global
non-halt (the open core).  Zero-mathlib, self-contained.

Layers (STRICT: FORMALIZED = `lake build` green + no `sorry` + axiom-audited):

* **L1 (the machine)** — `step`/`steps`: x2 as a step function on the tape
  zipper.  `step = none` iff HALT.  Reading the TNF spec carefully, the six
  fields are `A:1RB0RE · B:1RC--- · C:0LD1LE · D:0RE1LD · E:1RF0LC · F:0RA1RE`,
  so the ONLY halt transition is `B:1` (the `---`).  Kernel-`rfl` anchors at
  N = 50, 100 vs the exact Python simulator (`x2a_eraser.py` interpreter).

* **L2 (the halt gate, `halt_gate`)** — `step c = none ↔ (c.st = B ∧ head = 1)`,
  proved by cases on `(st, head)`.

* **L3 (the EVEN sweep — the target, `sweepEF`)** — the comb-REPACK, this
  machine's genuine even-structure channel: from state `E` on the leading `0`
  of a comb `(01)^m`, the 2-cycle `E:0→1RF · F:1→1RE` marches right, rewriting
  `(01)^m → 1^{2m}` in exactly `2m` steps, for EVERY `m`, by a one-tile base
  (`sweepEF_tile`, the 2-transition unit) + length induction — exactly the
  O3-`crawlR` / Template-`sweepBF` pattern.  KEY OUTPUT: the produced block has
  length `2*m` (EVEN for all `m`), captured as `sweepEF_even`.

* **L3′ (a second genuine sweep, `dSweepTurn`)** — the leftward `D`-sweep:
  `D:1→1LD` crosses a `1`-block of length `n+1` leftward and `D:0→0RE` turns it
  around into state `E` on the block's left edge, in `n+2` steps, arbitrary `n`
  by tile + induction (a self-contained crossing+turnaround, the `crawlL`
  analogue).

## Honest scope / relation to the arithmetic notes

The lab notes (`X2_ARITHMETIC_PROOF`, `X2_TEMPLATE_PROOF`, `x2a_eraser.py`)
describe an "`A1D0` eraser" 2-cycle `A:1→0LD · D:0→0LA` producing `(01)^j →
0^{2j}`.  **That 2-cycle is o4's (`Suffix.lean`'s `sweepAD`), NOT this
machine's** — here `A:1→0RE` and `D:0→0RE` both move RIGHT, and a brute-force
search confirms x2 has NO clean cell-zeroing uniform-crossing sweep.  The
even-gap stream `[2,4,4,6,8,…]` the Python `x2a_eraser.py` reports is an
EMERGENT parity of the full compound sweep on a boundary-contaminated isolated
comb (the script itself notes "the boundary differs, so the length is not the
in-context `2j`"), not a clean single-cycle lemma.  This machine's genuine,
cleanly-formalizable EVEN channel is the DUAL: the comb-repack `(01)^m → 1^{2m}`
(the base-2 doubling engine, `X2_TEMPLATE_PROOF` §1/§3.1), whose output length
`2m` is provably even for all `m`.  That is what `sweepEF` / `sweepEF_even`
formalize.

No `sorry`, no `native_decide`.  This file decides no machine; x2 stays `[OPEN]`.

`1`s of the block ahead): it shrinks the block by 2, deposits one `1 0` comb pair
on the left, and re-forms the `0^3` marker.  Composed by length induction
(`chewFold`) it drives a block `1^{2m+3}` down to `1^3` in `6m` steps, depositing
`pow10 m` — the `O3.crawlR` / `Suffix.sweepAD` pattern.  This is the cascade fold's
per-block inductive core: the `x2cc` executor's certified C1 lemma (proven ∀k,r

/-! ## §5c (G1) The cascade SEPARATOR-CROSS tile + the cascade FOLD over a
`List Nat` of non-uniform blocks — the doubling phase's variable-length list
induction, the exact piece the affine Python executor could NOT represent.

After `chewFold` grinds a cascade block `1^{2m+3}` down to `1^3`, the machine
must CROSS the `0^2` separator into the next block.  `sepCross_tile` (15 fixed
steps `D0·E1·C0·D1·E0·F0·A0·E0·F0·A0·E0·F0·A0·E1·C0`, kernel `rfl`) reads the
fixed window `0^3 1^3 0^2 1^2` (the marker, the ground-down `1^3`, the separator,
and the first two `1`s of the NEXT block), deposits the comb pattern
`(01)^2 0^2 1` on the left, shifts `+7`, and re-forms `[D] 0^3 …` sitting on the
next block — which it trims by 2 (`1^{2s+5} → 1^{2s+3}`).  Composing
`chewFold m · sepCross_tile` gives the per-block step `blockStep`
(`= x2co_compose.py`'s certified `L1`, here a Lean tile+fold).  `cascadeFold`
then ITERATES `blockStep` over an arbitrary `List Nat bs` of block sizes by LIST
INDUCTION (the o4 `prefix_bodies` / o3 `body_iter` analogue): this is `G1` of
`X2_COMPOSITION_2026-07-11.md` — the fold the `x2cc` fixed-length-run executor
provably cannot express (block entry sizes `61,29,13,5,1` are all distinct, no
uniform `config(p)→config(p−1)` shift).  Every step lands `some` ⇒ HALT-FREE (the
`E`-met gap-3 halt gate never fires anywhere in the whole cascade). -/

/-! ## §5d (G3, arithmetic core) The big-block doubling identity in `2^K`.

The milestone big block is `B_K = 2^K − 3`; the doubling phase's register-rebuild
must equate the rebuilt block to `B_{K+1} = 2^{K+1} − 3`, i.e. prove
`2·B_K + 3 = B_{K+1}` — exponential (`2^K`) arithmetic that the affine Python
executor provably could NOT represent (`X2_COMPOSITION` §3, G3).  In Lean's `Nat`
it is a two-line fact.  This formalizes the *arithmetic core* of G3 (the
"couples-to-`2^K`" identity); it does NOT by itself close G3 — wiring it to the
`cascadeFold` output (proving the accumulated comb-total equals `B_K`, so the
repack yields exactly `B_{K+1}`) is the part that remains open (see the honest
scope note at the foot of this file). -/

/-! ## §7 Honest scope of this file (what is FORMALIZED vs OPEN).

FORMALIZED here (`lake build` green, no `sorry`, no `native_decide`, axioms
`[propext, Quot.sound]` only):

* the x2 machine `step`/`steps` + halt gate (`step = none ↔ B reads 1`);
* the doubling-engine sweeps `sweepEF` (comb-repack `(01)^m → 1^{2m}` ∀m) and
  `dSweepTurn` (`1`-block crossing ∀n);
* the cascade CHEW `chew_tile`/`chewFold` (block `1^{2m+3} → 1^3` ∀m);
* **G1 — the cascade FOLD** (`sepCross_tile`, `blockStep`, `cascadeFold`): the
  per-block step composed over an ARBITRARY, non-uniform `List Nat` of blocks by
  List induction, halt-free (`some`) for every list.  This closes the exact
  representational gap flagged in `X2_COMPOSITION_2026-07-11.md` §3 (G1) — the
  fold the affine Python executor (fixed-length run-lists) provably could not
  express, here a routine Lean `List` recursion;
* **G3 arithmetic core** — `doubling_id`: `2·(2^K−3)+3 = 2^{K+1}−3`, the
  exponential (`2^K`) block-doubling identity the affine executor could not
  represent.

STILL OPEN (NOT in this file — the exact remaining Lean gaps to a decision):

1. **Low phase M1(g)→M6(g) ∀g** — the full sweep-induction that x2's low phase
   emits only gaps `{18,10,2(g+1),6-iff-even}`, never 3 (Python-`x2cc_prove`
   PROVEN, not yet ported; it is the analogue of the entire `Template`+`Suffix`
   generation-map, ~1k lines).
2. **G2** — the entry / `10^10`-marked big-block R/L sweep / repack as PARAMETRIC
   tiles (bounded, machine-checked g=2..6 only).
3. **G3 wiring** — `cascadeFold` takes an ARBITRARY block list; it is NOT yet
   instantiated at the milestone cascade (blocks `2^j−3`), and the accumulated
   comb-total is NOT yet equated (via `doubling_id`) to the rebuilt block
   `2^{K+1}−3`.  Wiring the fold OUTPUT to `M1(g+1)` — the register-rebuild — is
   the deepest remaining step.
4. **The milestone form M(g) and the composed `x2_nonhalt`** — the nested cascade
   as a concrete `Cfg`, the transport `M1(g)→M1(g+1)` ∀g, and the prefix-closed
   non-halt (`∀n, steps n init ≠ none`) — NONE assembled.

**Verdict: NO decision.**  This file advances the formalization by closing G1
(the fold engine) and G3's arithmetic core with clean axioms, but x2 stays
`[OPEN]`: the low-phase composition, G2, the G3 register-rebuild wiring, and the
top-level `x2_nonhalt` are not formalized.  No label upgraded. -/
